                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    The Airbus A380 aka superjumbo, is a wide-body aircraft manufactured by Airbus. It is the world's
                    largest passenger airliner. Airbus's plan was to challenge the Boeing 747 which was
                    dominating the long haul market. Studies have been carried out in 1988 and the project
                    was announced in 1990. On 19 December 2000, Airbus launched the $10.7 billion A380
                    programme. The first delivery was made on 15 October 2007 to Singapore Airlines. In
                    2019, Airbus announced that the A380 production would end in 2021 as its $25 billion
                    investment can't be recouped and demand for the airliner was dropping.

                        other common airliners in the market. The A380-800 has the most capacity in an airliner.
                        It has a typical seating of 525 passengers, with a maximum certified capacity for 853
                        passengers.

                <h2>Cumulative Orders & Deliveries From Year 2001 âž¡ 2021</h2>
                <p>
                    Emirates had the largest amount of orders. Since 2019, many airlines such as Emirates,
                    Virgin Atlantic & Lufthansa cancel many of their orders. Where we can see a sharp drop
                    in orders in the viz below on 2019 when the Covid-19 pandemic hit. The pandemic also
                    contributed to the drop in orders for the A380-800 as the aviation industry was heavily affected.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    On 14 February, Emirates decided to cancel its order for 39 A380s and replaced them with A350s &
                    A330neos.
                    The final 3 orders are to be delivered to Emirates which the last A380 is scheduled to be delivered
                    in December 2021.

                <h2>End Of An Era</h2>
                <p>
                    As of October 2021, Airbus has received 251 firm orders, of which 248 had
                    been delivered. Airbus's target was to sell 700 of the A380-800 in total.
                    However, Airbus was forced to cease production of the A380-800 due to lack
                    of demand. Even though the A380-800 was popular with passengers, most airlines
                    view it as inefficient. Some of the reasons were: unfilled seats were unprofitable,
                    rising prices of fuel, environmental impact, airlines opting for smaller, but more
                    efficient planes produced by both Boeing and Airbus.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Some airlines were interested in Boeing's new family of 777s which deliveries would
                    start in 2020. It offers fewer seats, but the same range as the A380-800, more payload
                    and 2 fewer engines.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Even though the A380-800 production is soon to cease, it would be unlikely for the airliner to
                    disappear from the skies any time soon. However, this airliner will be remembered for its
                    engineering marvel.
